## Where we're at currently
4th year undergrad at UCI! Environmental Engineering major but also minoring in Earth System Science and Economics :) 
Loving oceanography research! Definitely hoping to learn more about it and see if there are any projects of interest for a PhD.
Trying to understand a bit more about coding because aPpArEnTlY coding bleeds into EVERYTHING. Never been very good with tech so this should be fun...  But anyways that's why we're here I guess. Practice Practice. 

## Next moves
funny 

No but seriously I have to plan SOMEthing 
### Research
- [ ] Understand the role that missing topography and resolution play in WBC separation - specifically the Kuroshio but also see how Oyashio is impacted
- [ ] Last chance to check vertical structure on KvMIX. Review Kawasaki paper on downwelling induced by mixing not reached by the top. 
- [ ] Put together slides to show Moore what you have learned about the KvMIX. Focus will be on Nakamura, Kawasaki, and Yagi papers. Little bit of Tanaka.
- [ ] Begin writing up a review of the work done 
   - [ ] First go over the areas of interest: what is going on in the Physics, how might BGC be impacted, and why should this matter in climate models?
   - [ ] Create a section for the model, and use some of the Harrison paper to go over what goes into it? Moore will have to provide more info on the final ecosystem and parameters used
   - [ ] get into main results: start off with the one degree and then go into the sets of 3 degree models
   - [ ] Discussion (the doozy): "easy" part will be explaining Fe impacts on bio and how KvMIX is affecting scavenging of nuts. Talk about salt/temp anomalies
